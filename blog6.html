            <p class="font1">Hello everyone, I am here again with the last Blog of my journey as an Outreachy intern. For those who don't know me , I am Neelima Mohanty , selected as an Outreachy intern at Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOTOSM) for the May to August Cohort. If you are new to my blog then make sure you read my previous <a href="index.html">Outreachy Blogs</a> before going through this blog post.</p> 
            
             
                
            
              
                <br>
                <br>
               
                
                <p class="font1">Just 3 months ago I received an email at my inbox from the Outreachy organizers according to which I got selected as an intern at Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team for the May to August 2023 cohort . And look today my internship is going to end in just two days . So I planned to take you all into a rollercoaster ride of my internship journey .
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <br>
                 
                <p class="font1">In the first month I was welcomed by my mentors Rob Savoye and Petya Kangalova where Petya introduced me about the HOT Community . Next I was assigned with many github issues from the projects FMTM and osm-fieldwork by my mentor Rob . I still remember Rob saying me " Don't get overwhelmed by seeing the number of issues assigned . Just pick one and start working now and you don't have to complete all . Take your time and complete only as much as you can comfortably" . These words were so relaxing for me . 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Throughout the months of June and July , I and my mentors worked together . I created PRs and they reviewed it , left comments . I worked on them and finally they merged them . One great thing that I always liked and appreciate is that Petya and Rob always respond quickly to my messages and Rob reviews my PRs in seconds in the most perfect way . I also worked with other members of HOT like Kshitij and Omran for another HOT project called fAIr.

                    <br>
                    In the last month of my internship Petya and Rob offered me an opportunity to be a co-speaker at the Lightning Talk for the FMTM project at Code for All Summit which I accepted and completed . It will be released on 20th September 2023 on Code for All You tube channel and social media handles. Do watch it .

                    Yesterday Outreachy organizers had organized a Wrap up chat with all the May to August 2023 cohort interns and mentors where we gave appreciations to our mentors and the organizers gave us a happy farewell. 
                    <br>
                    As now the internship has come to an end , I am invited to attend the Wrap-up Social Event Virtual Meet by Outreachy on 24th August 2023. And my internship ends on 25th August 2023.
                    <br>
                    My mentors have also scheduled a Wrap-up meet for me on 29th
                    August 2023 in which personally I and mentors will talk about my Outreachy journey and also future opportunities. I am very excited for both the upcoming events.

                    I thank Outreachy and HOT tech team for giving me such a wonderful opportunity.
                    Finally a huge shoutout to my mentors Rob Savoye and Petya Kangalova for being with me and assisting me at every step of my journey as an intern . 
                    That's it friends , my Outreachy internship journey ends here.
