            <p class="font1">Hello everyone, I am here again with the 5th Blog of my journey as an Outreachy intern. For those who don't know me , I am Neelima Mohanty , selected as an Outreachy intern at Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOTOSM) for the May to August Cohort. If you are new to my blog then make sure you read my previous <a href="index.html">Outreachy Blogs</a> before going through this blog post.</p> 
            
             
                
            
              
                <br>
                <br>
               
                
                <p class="font1">This is the second last week of my Outreachy internship and I almost feel like I am a part of the HOT Community or in other words I feel like I know many members of HOT already. Apart from my mentors Rob Savoye and Petya Kangalova , the list of members whom I know are Kshitij Raj Sharma , Omran Najjar , Susmina Manandhar and Sam Woodcock . Informal chats with all these people made me more familiar with this community.
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <br>
                 
                <p class="font1">Let me introduce all of them to you and what I have learnt from the informal chats with them.

                    Kshitij and Omran are part of the dev team for fAIr project of HOT . I learnt a lot from each one of them about backend and frontend of that project and understood their work to implement AI in the process of mapping . 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I already have written about my interaction with Sam Woodcock in my 2nd Blog . But that was how we came to know each other for the first time . Whereas when I got selected as an Intern , he sent me a message introducing himself and told me that he would like to help me in my technical documentation work in FMTM if I face any issues . Then I came to know that he had been volunteering for FMTM since a long time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And finally and very recently I met with Susmina Manandhar from Nepal who works as an Associate Project Manager at NAXA one of the partners of HOT . 
                    We together worked for two weeks and prepared the Lightning Talk Video of the FMTM project for Code for All summit. While in these two weeks , we met almost everyday and not just talked about work but she also shared about herself and her University days . 
                    
                    
                </p>

                <br>
                  
                <p class="font1">How can I miss the part that every week when I meet with my mentors we always talk about a lot stuff which is informal like Open source conferences , work opportunities and even about coffee ðŸ˜Š. In fact Petya and Rob are the ones who gave me the opportunity to speak in the Lightning Talk at Code for All Summit which is a evidence our Informal chats.
                    I would also like to thank my mentors Rob Savoye and Petya Kangalova again for being with me and assisting me at every step of my journey as an intern . 
                    That's it friends , meet you next time with Blog 6.
                    Till then bye ðŸ˜Š
