            <p class="font1">Hello everyone, I am here again with the 4th Blog of my journey as an Outreachy intern. For those who don't know me , I am Neelima Mohanty , selected as an Outreachy intern at Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOTOSM) for the May to August Cohort. If you are new to my blog then make sure you read my previous <a href="index.html">Outreachy Blogs</a> before going through this blog post.</p>

                <br>
               
                
                <p class="font1">This blog post will help you to know me better and offer me job or internship opportunity according to my skills after I complete my Outreachy internship.

                <br>
                 <h2>My skills and experience</h2> 
                <p class="font1">Being a Computer Science and Engineering Student , I have learned a list of technical skills and am still learning more. As I believe that learning without implementation is worthless thus I have had experience of each skill that I have learned in the form of internships in various organisations.
                    I welcome everyone here to have a look into my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dVNWlLBRol7XqUYzBTwpl9Sa2x2DmjSZ/view?usp=sharing" >Resume</a> to know about my experiences and skills in detail.

                <h2>Opportunities I am looking for</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p class="font1">I am looking for developer roles as well as technical writer roles . I will be interested to work and assist on job or internship related to any of the following domains : web development , app development , AI/ML , Cloud Computing or technical writing. I am eager to contribute my skills and assist in any capacity within these areas.

                <h2>What makes me Unique for your organisation?</h2>
                <p class="font1">Below are some of my interpersonal skills which I consider as my strengths for an job/internship opportunity:
                    
                </p>
                <div class="step"><h2>â€¢	Team leadership and Team spirit </h2></div>
                <p class="font1">I already have the experience of being a team leader to a team during few internships and projects . So I respect the concept of teamwork and collaboration. 
                </p>
                
                <hr>
                <div class="step"><h2>â€¢	Communication</h2></div>
                <p class="font1">I consider communication is a cornerstone of a successful job environment. It enhances teamwork, information sharing, relationship-building, performance management, and leadership effectiveness. Strong communication skills contribute to a positive work culture, increased productivity, and successful outcomes in the workplace.
                </p>
                
                <div class="step"><h2>â€¢	Problem solving skills </h2></div>
                <p class="font1">I also have problem-solving skills that are highly valuable in a job environment as they enable individuals to identify, analyze, and find effective solutions to various challenges and obstacles. 
                    
                </p>

                <br>
                <h2>Other important points</h2>
                <p class="font1">Below are my preferences regarding a job/internship opportunity:
                    
                </p>
               <br>
                <p class="font1"><b>Availability to Start : </b> I am available to work just after the Outreachy May to August - 2023 internship .  
                </p>
                
                <br>
               
                <p class="font1"><b>Work location : </b>I would prefer remote job/internship more over on-location job/internship as of now.
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p class="font1"><b>Employment Type : </b> Although both full time and part-time work are fine for me but as currently I am a student so I will prefer part-time job/internship.


                </p>
                <p class="font1"><b>Languages I speak : </b> From childhood till now my top prioritised language has been English as I have studied in English medium school and University . I am fluent in both speaking ang writing in English . Other than that I also know my National language Hindi.

                <p class="font1">So if you think my skills match the requirements of the job/internship at your community or organisation please let me know and offer it to me if I am eligible . I would also like to thank my mentors Rob Savoye and Petya Kangalova again for being with me and assisting me at every step of my journey as an intern .
